### Hi there, I'm Lucas

I create highly interactive web applications.

I'm a 100% self-tought fullstack developer, creating both the frontend and backend, managing anything from databases to background colors.

My current favorite frontend/fullstack framework is SvelteKit as it is efficent, fast and fun to develop with.
TypeScript is what's running all the bits and pieces on both sides of the applications.

However, I am also resarching and learning other languages and skills, such as:
- Web/cloud hosting
- Rust
- C#
- General computer and IT skills, etc.
- Contributing and developing as part of a team
